# Bucket - File Sharing App for a Specific Group

Uploading and sharing files has never been easier! File Bucket focuses on file sharing more than anything. It uses Google's Firebase services as a backend; specifically FirebaseAuth, Firestore and Storage. So you'll need have to worry about security and reliability.
