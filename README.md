# Bucket - File Sharing App for a Specific Group

This is the source code for the app, "Bucket" which is written by me for my university and as a final project

## Motivation
As a student, we need access and share all of our academic materials that our instructors have given us. Unfortunately, the app of choice for instant messaging have implemented a dark mode before the attachment of files. So I decided to make an app that will store and handle our materials.

## Details
* Native Android App
* Written in Kotlin (why not?)
* Depends on Open Source Libraries
* Uses Firebase as back-end
